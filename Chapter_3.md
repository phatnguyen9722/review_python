# Chapter 3: Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. </br>
- A dictionary is a collection which is `ordered*`, `changeable` and `do not allow duplicates`. </br>
- Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values </br>
###### As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
