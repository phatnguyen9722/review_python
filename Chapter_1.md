### 1. Basic syntax
-----
#### Python Indentation
- `Indentation` refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. </br>
- Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. </br>
- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. </br>

#### Python Variables
- In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it </br>
- Variable names are case-sensitive (A != a). </br>

### 5. Type Casting
-----
#### Specify a Variable Type
- There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types. </br>
- Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions: </br>
    - `int()` - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
    - `float()` - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
    - `str()` - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

### 6. Python Collections (Arrays)
-----
- There are four `collection data types` in the Python programming language: </br>
    - `List` is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. </br> 
    - `Tuple` is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. </br> 
    - `Set` is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members. </br> 
    - `Dictionary` is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members. </br>
